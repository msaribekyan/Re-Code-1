Multi-Label Text Classifier

## How to run

Install Jupyter notebook. First run the re:code-classification.ipynb then predict.ipynb.

Running first Jupyter notebook file will create two other files called model.pkl and tdidf.pkl. Do NOT delete these files, they are used for the prediction pipeline, I repeat, do NOT delete these files.
